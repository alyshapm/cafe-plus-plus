# Café++ Project
## Project Overview
Café++ is a command-line application designed to simulate a computer-controlled café environment. This application employs several design patterns, including Facade, Mediator, and Factory, to manage interactions between various components such as patrons, orders, and the café's backend systems.

## Folder Structure
- `part 2`: Contains the initial implementation of the café system.
- `part 3`: Contains extended features and additional implementations.
- 
## Features
- Take orders from patrons for pre-defined food and drinks.
- Extendable design allowing for easy addition of new food and drink types.
- Simulates order processing using design patterns such as Facade, Mediator, and Factory.
